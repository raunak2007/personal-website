            <p>While presenting our project, we collected test data on feedback that our in order to see which areas of our project we need to grow in.
            I plan to use the test data in order to find specific areas of our project to work with in Trimester 3.</p>
            <p>The first thing that I plan to do is add more credits to our API (or upgrade to a better plan) so that more users can use it as indicated by Rachit.
            In addition, we will add a dropdown menu that has programming languages as requested by Haseeb.</p>
            <p>Another minor modification that we will do is to add multiple candidates that have the best proficiency in a skills in a certain location as requested by Paaras.
            This makes sense because most employers in reality would want to look at multiple candidates to ensure that they have a variety of potential employees rather than having to choose whether they want to reject or hire one singular candidate.</p>
